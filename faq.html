<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<ul class="collapsible">
    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">star</i>What makes this different from the other solitaire implementations?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
      <p>This solitaire is all about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>. 
      Anything that distracts from your interaction with the flow of the game has been either been tried and removed or not included. 
      Crucially, the games can be played by single-clicking the card you wish to move, and the software figures out where you want the card to go 
      (mostly to the foundation if possible, and if not, the biggest tableau). If you don't like where the card goes, 
      just try clicking it again or drag it.
      </p>
      <p>Also, I'm trying to make games authentic, by taking the rules from reputable sources
      and implementing them exactly. For example, the tableau shuffling algorithm for Cruel and Perseverance
      has been <a href="https://politaire.com/article/cruel.html" target="_blank">chosen carefully</a>,
      Penguin works as the author intended, 
      Blockade refills empty tableaux from the stock,
      Baker's Dozen shuffles kings to he bottom of each tableau and
      Frog/Toad moves aces out of the reserve and only allows cards to be moved to certain places.

    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">photo</i>Why are the graphics so basic?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span> 
      <p>Anything that distracts from your interaction with the flow of the game, 
      or the ability to scan a deck of cards,
      has either been tried and removed, or not included. 
      This includes: 
      fancy card designs (front and back), 
      changing the screen/baize background, 
      animating card flips, 
      keeping an arbitrary score, 
      distracting graphics on the screen, 
      and forcing you to drag the cards to move them.</p>
      <p>The user interface tries to stick to the Material Design guidelines, and so is minimal and tactile.
      I looked at a lot of the other solitaire websites out there, and think how distracting some of them are. 
      Features seem to have been added because the developers thought they were cool; 
      they never seem to have stopped to 
      consider that just because they <em>could</em> implement a feature, that they <em>should</em>.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">format_size</i>Sometimes the cards are really huge or really tiny</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
      Resize your browser window. 
      <em>If the cards are big and you can't see the ones at the the bottom, try making your browser
      window narrower.</em> 
      The cards and playing area will scale automatically.

    <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">format_list_numbered</i>The rules for a variation are wrong</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
      There's no ISO or ANSI or FIDE-like governing body for solitaire; so there's no standard set of rules.
      Other implementations vary in how they interpret each variant.
      For example, some variants of American Toad build the tableau down by suit, some by alternate color.
      So, rather than just making this stuff up, I've tried to find a well researched set of rules for each variant and stick to them,
      leaning heavily on Jan Wolter (RIP, and thanks for all the fish), David Parlett and Thomas Warfield.
      Where possible, I've implemented the games from the book 
      "The Complete Book of Solitaire and Patience Games" by Albert Morehead and Geoffrey Mott-Smith.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">bookmark</i>Can I get to the individual games directly?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Yes. Each game variant has it's own web page; just bookmark the game you like in your browser.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">data_usage</i>Can I play offline?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Yes. There's no traffic between the game and the server once it's loaded.
      Game scores are stored in your web browser, and optionally in your personal cloud storage, not on the game's server. 
      There's no login, no cookies apart from the Google Analytics stuff, and the software doesn't know who or where you are.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">cloud</i>Saving game progress</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>
      <p>Your scores and progress in the game is normally saved in the web browser.
      You can optionally save your game progress to your personal cloud storage, so you can transfer your progress to several different devices and browsers.
      Currently, saving to Dropbox is implemented (Google Drive support is being worked on).</p>
      <p>If you don't already have a Dropbox account, you can create a free one at <a href="https://www.dropbox/com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox</a>.</p>
      <p>The software will create a folder called <code>Apps</code> in your Dropbox storage area, and a folder called <code>Oddstream Solitaire</code> within that.
      <strong>(This software only has access to that folder, and can't see or do anything with the rest of your stuff.)</strong>
      Within that folder, this software will create a file called <code>gameState.json</code> that contains your progress in the games you have played.
      You are free to make a backup copy of this file.</p>
      <p>Start the process by clicking on the cloud icon in the <code>index.html</code> title bar.
      Then click on the 'Get Access Token' button.
      In the window that pops up, sign into Dropbox and then grant this software access.
      An 'access token' will be returned.
      Thereafter, click on the 'Sync' button to save/load your game state between Dropbox and the browser,
      or set the sync selector to auto to have this happen automatically when the <code>index.html</code>
      page is loaded or unloaded.
      You can sever the connection to Dropbox by deleting the displayed access token (doing this won't delete any Dropbox files or folders).</p>
      <p>The games only sync from the opening <code>index.html</code> page, not the individual game pages.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">favorite</i>My favourite variation is not included</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Email me with the name of the variation, and why you like it so much. 
      I'm aiming for a well chosen collection of 100 variations. Easthaven and Agnes Sorel might be taken out because,
      although well known, they're just about unwinnable. Unless someone can explain the virtue of that.
      
      For some reason I don't like the games where you have to match pairs of cards that make a certain number, like 13 (Pyramid).
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accordion_(solitaire)">Accordian</a> is just about the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">score</i>What about scores?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Nope, the software doesn't keep an arbitary score. Too confusing. 
      Just the number of moves made, number of wins, and your winning streak (streaks are great).
      A game isn't counted at all until you move a card. 
      Thereafter, if you ask for a new deal, or to replay the current deal, that counts as a loss.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">timer</i>What about a timer?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Nope, there isn't one of those. Too stressful.
      Solitaire is also called patience; it's hard to feel patient when you're pressured by a clock.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">casino</i>Is the game rigged?</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
        No. The cards are shuffled randomly using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fisher-Yates</a> shuffle 
        driven by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehmer_random_number_generator">Park-Miller</a> pseudo random number generator, 
        which is in itself seeded by a random number. This mechanism was tested and analysed to make sure it produced an even distribution of shuffled cards. 
        There are <a href="http://qi.com/infocloud/playing-cards">80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000</a> 
        possible deals of a pack of 52 playing cards; you're never going to play the same game twice, nor indeed play the same game 
        that anyone else ever has, or ever will.

        <p><em>Animation speed</em> different browsers animate at different speeds, and folks differ in how fast they expect
        the cards to move around.
        It's fun to set the animation to it's slowest speed and see how many cards you can have animating at the same time.
        </p>
        <p><em>Highlight movable cards</em> if a card has an available move, then it will appear lighter than one that doesn't.
        It makes moveable cards easier to see. Whether or not the move is useful is up to you.
        </p>
        <p><em>Allow single click to move a card</em> instead of having to drag the cards around.
        </p>
        <p><em>Auto collection</em> to encourage the software to move a card 
        from the tableau to a foundation when it is safe to do so.
        The cards do not auto collect from any waste or reserve piles; that would make the games too easy.

        There is a known bug where a card will not animate to it's destination.
        If this happens, press 'S' (to save the current game) and then 'L' (to reload it).
        If you can find a way to reproduce this bug, then please let me know.

      <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">phone</i>The game is weird on my phone/tablet</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
      The game is aimed at modern desktop browers
      (Chrome, Edge and Firefox seem good, Internet Explorer is a complete non-starter).
      <br/>
      The app runs well on mobile Chrome in fullscreen. Do this by tapping the Menu button (three vertical dots) in the upper right-hand 
      corner of the screen (or tap the hardware menu button on those devices having one) and selecting Add to homescreen from the menu. 
      Tap the Add button in the pop up dialog. Then, from the home screen, tap the app icon to open in fullscreen mode.
      <br/>
      If you have an Android phone, you can download the mobile version from the <a hef="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oddstream.solitaire">Google Play Store</a>.
